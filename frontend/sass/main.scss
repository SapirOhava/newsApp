// to understand this file look again the net ninja video num 19 on customizing bootstrap

//this is the way to override the bootstrap variables,etc..

$primary: rgba(188, 55, 148, 0.6);

//dont worry it wont override our variables , because the variables
// inside the bootstrap nodemodules are set using the default statement
// example: $primary  $blue !default;
// this !default is a sass feature that means only apply this value if
// one already hasn't been declared, but because i did declared here before the import the primary variable it will use my primary variable.
// and now whats left is to compile our sass into a final css file which will then use in out html page. i can use any sass compiler that i want,
// he uses a package for vscode called live sass compiler , this package watch a sass file for changes and then automatically compile that sass file into a css file(whenever a change is made and saved)
//  i use here the cdn option - and the sass compiler just compile this to a minfied css which then i use instead of the css cdn version one but what i need to do is use the npm bootstrap packagae and do the overridind sass with webpack

//@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";
